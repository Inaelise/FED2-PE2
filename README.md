# Project Exam 2 - Holidaze

![image](/public/images/holidaze-screenshot.jpg)

## Description

This is my Project Exam 2 delivery. I've used all the skills we've learned in the past two years in the FED program.

All API functionality is managed by an existing application. The API used in the project is the Holidaze endpoint in the Noroff API. The website is responsive and allow users to view and book venues.

We were required to use a planning application and a design application. Another requirement was to use a JavaScript framework and a CSS framework, I chose to build my site with React + Vite and TailwindCSS. We also had to deploy the project to a hosting service.

### The Brief

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front-end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front-end accommodation booking application.
There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

#### Terminology

- Visitor - a user who has not registered or logged in.
- Customer - a user who had registered and logged in as a customer.
- Venue manager - a user who has registered and logged in as a venue manager.
